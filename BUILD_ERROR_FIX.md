# üîß Build Error Fix - Environment Variables

## Problem

The build is failing because Supabase environment variables are not configured in Webflow Cloud. The error occurs during `npm run build` because Next.js embeds `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` environment variables at build time.

## ‚úÖ Solution Applied

I've updated the code to:
1. **Gracefully handle missing environment variables** - The build will now succeed even if variables aren't set
2. **Provide clear error messages** - Runtime errors will tell you exactly what's missing
3. **Allow middleware to skip** - If variables aren't set, middleware won't block the build

## üìã What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Get Your Supabase Credentials

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings** ‚Üí **API**
3. Copy these values:
   - **Project URL**: `https://xxxxx.supabase.co`
   - **anon/public key**: The `anon` `public` key

### Step 2: Add Environment Variables to Webflow Cloud

You need to add these environment variables to your Webflow Cloud project:

1. **Open Webflow Dashboard**:
   - Go to your Webflow site
   - Click on **Webflow Cloud** or navigate to your project settings

2. **Find Environment Variables**:
   - Look for **Environment Variables** or **Build Settings**
   - This is usually in the project settings or deployment settings

3. **Add the Variables**:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
   ```

   Replace with your actual Supabase credentials.

### Step 3: Redeploy

After adding the environment variables:

```bash
npm run deploy
# or
webflow cloud deploy
```

The build should now succeed!

## üîç Why This Happened

1. **Build-time variables**: Next.js requires `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables to be available during build
2. **Missing configuration**: The variables weren't set in Webflow Cloud's build environment
3. **Build process**: Webflow Cloud runs `npm run build` which needs these variables

## üí° Alternative: Local Build Test

To test the build locally first:

1. **Create/Update `.env.local`**:
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
   ```

2. **Test build locally**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   If this succeeds, your Webflow Cloud build should also succeed once you add the variables.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Never commit `.env.local`** - It's already in `.gitignore`
- **Use Webflow Cloud environment variables** - Don't rely on `.env.local` for production
- **Security**: The `anon` key is safe to expose (it's designed for client-side use)
- **Build vs Runtime**: Variables are embedded at build time, so they must be set before deployment

## üêõ Still Having Issues?

If the build still fails:

1. **Check variable names**: Make sure they're exactly:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

2. **Verify values**: Make sure there are no extra spaces or quotes

3. **Check Webflow Cloud docs**: Refer to Webflow Cloud documentation for environment variable setup

4. **Test locally**: Run `npm run build` locally to see if there are other issues

## üìö Next Steps

Once the build succeeds:
- Authentication will work as expected
- Protected routes will function correctly
- User sign in/sign up will work
- All Supabase features will be available
